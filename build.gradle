This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version compatibility.  The error message itself might not directly pinpoint the conflict but will often manifest as a build failure related to dependency resolution or conflicting versions of Android libraries.  Often, this stems from mismatches between the AGP version specified in your `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file, your project-level `build.gradle` file, and the versions of dependencies in your `build.gradle` files (app level and potentially others).
