The solution involves verifying and aligning the AGP versions across your Gradle files. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Check `gradle-wrapper.properties`:** Ensure that the `distributionUrl` points to a Gradle version that's compatible with the AGP version you intend to use.  You might need to update this to a recent Gradle version, but don't choose one that is too new without verifying compatibility.

2. **Check `android/build.gradle` (Project-level):**  Check the `dependencies` block for the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` plugin and ensure its version is consistent with other project files.

3. **Check `android/app/build.gradle` (App-level):** Check the `plugins` block or the `dependencies` block (depending on your Gradle version) for Android Gradle Plugin and ensure it's compatible. This file often shows the most crucial declaration.

4. **Dependency Resolution:** Review dependencies in the app-level `build.gradle` for any libraries with conflicting AGP version requirements.  Update these libraries to ones compatible with your chosen AGP version.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making any version changes, clean and rebuild your project using the Expo CLI: `expo prebuild` and `expo run:android`.
